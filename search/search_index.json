Please note, plug-ins only work with THETA V, not earlier THETA models. And a separate purchase of a miniUSB to USB \"On-the-Go\" Adapter is required.\n\n\nUSB On-The-Go (OTG) is a standardized specification for USB connections that allows a device to read data from a USB connection.\n\n\nVideo Tutorial\n\n\nRicoh Theta V USB Data Transfer to Flash Drive FAT32\n\n\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall latest THETA V firmware (2.10.1 and above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect to your THETA V via the mobile app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch the THETA mobile app and go to Camera Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Plug-in select USB Data Transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, from the Setting menu in the lower right corner, choose Camera Settings\n\n\n\n\nThen confirm that the Plug-in is set to USB Data Transfer\n\n\n\n\nYour THETA V will retain this setting. You should not need your phone again to enable USB Transfer Mode.\n\n\nTransferning Files\n\n\nTo transfer files off your THETA V to a flash drive, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nInsert and connect your FLASH DRIVE via an OTG Micro USB adapter to the THETA V\u2019s Micro USB port. \n\n\n\n\nA Micro USB OTG adapter cable or a OTG Flash Drive with dual Micro USB/USB connectors will work.  \n\n\n\n\nMake sure your flash drive is formatted as MSDOS FAT32. \n\n\nAmazon link: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M127X8F/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1\n\n\n\n\n2.With the camera powered on, press and hold the mode button until the camera status light turns WHITE. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera is now in USB Data Transfer Mode.\n\n\n3.Start the transfer by pressing and releasing the shutter button. The camera icon will flash and blink during the transfer.\n\n\n DO NOT DISCONNECT DRIVE DURING TRANSFER.\n (Be patient!)\n\n\nOnce the transfer is done, the camera status light returns to BLUE. You can now disconnect the flash drive.\n\n\nThe files should now be on the flash drive and the original files deleted from the camera.\n\n\nThe THETA is now ready to shoot again.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan files larger than 4GB be transfered?\n Files larger than 4GBs in size will not transfer. If the THETA V has an assortment of movie clips and one of them exceeds 4GBs in size, it will not transfer ANY of the files. The transfer process will not start and it exits the USB transfer mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill an SSD work?\n Yes, it has been tested with a 240GB SanDisk SSD formatted in MSDOS FAT32 and the transfer worked correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if there is not enough space in destination drive?\n Currently not tested",
